# DjangoDiary
Personal Diary using Django

This is my first Django project, created to explore and showcase key backend development concepts like User Authentication System, CRUD operations, API integration, and UI design. The web app allows users to securely write, manage, and edit their personal diary entries. Users can also view current world news built with the help of API integration.

## Features

- **User Authentication** (Register / Login / Logout)
- **Personal Diary** – Add, view, edit, and delete your daily entries
- **Live News Feed** – Get current world headlines using the News API

- **User Authentication System**- Secure Register, Login and Logout system.
- **Personal Diary** – Users can add, view, edit, and delete their personal diary entries.
- **Live News Feed** – Users can be notified about the current world headlines built by using the News API.
- Beginner-friendly code structure.
- Responsive layout for clean readability.

## Tech Stack
