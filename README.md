# DjangoDiary
Personal Diary using Django

This is my first Django project, created to explore and showcase key backend development concepts like User Authentication System, CRUD operations, API integration, and UI design. The web app allows users to securely write, manage, and edit their personal diary entries. Users can also view current world news built with the help of API integration.
